With Redmine, you can \nretrieve genomic data\n\n(either raw reads or draft assemblies) that is stored at OLC to perform your own analysis locally, \nlook for\nantibiotic resistance genes\n or \nfind plasmids\n in assemblies,\n\ncreate phylogenetic trees\n, compare \nstrains against RefSeq\n, and more.\n\n\nIf a tool you need is not currently available, we are generally able to add tools on request.\n\n\nAccessing Redmine\n\n\nTo access Redmine, go to \nhttps://redmine.biodiversity.agr.gc.ca\n (note that you\nmust be on the CFIA/Agriculture Canada network). Once there, login with your corporate username and password. If this is\nyour first time using Redmine, you will need to be added to the CFIA Genomics project.

This is where you will\nbe able to create requests.\n\n\nChanging Email Settings\n\n\nBy default, Redmine likes to send you emails about literally every issue that anybody reports, which can lead to\nreceiving far more emails than anybody has ever wanted to receive. To change this, click on the \nMy Account\n button (found\nin the top right corner when logged in to Redmine) and change the dropdown for email notifications from \nFor any event\non all my projects\n to something else - I recommend \nOnly for things I watch or I'm involved in\n. Once that's done, hit\nthe \nSave\n button on the bottom left of the screen to make sure Redmine remembers your email preferences.\n\n\nCreating Issues\n\n\nEverything in Redmine is done by creating \nIssues\n - these are requests for an analysis to be done.\n\n\nTo create a new issue, click on the \nNew Issue\n button, as shown in the below screenshot.\n\n\n`Click to see screenshot`\n\n\n![Screenshot](img/Redmine_Overview.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe page for new issues can be seen in the next screenshot. To have your analyses done, specific keywords are put in the\n\nSubject\n header, with any necessary details put in the \nDescription\n section. Details on what exactly needs to be put\ninto each section are under the \nData\n and \nAnalysis\n tabs for specific tools. Once an issue has been filled out, click\non the \nCreate\n button.

Put the username in the first line of the description, password \nin the second line, and the folder specified in the third (it should be something like  uploads/youremail_a1d3a1 ).\nIn subsequent lines, put the SeqIDs you want to upload files for. Once the request finishes running, you should be \nable to find a folder named with your Redmine issue ID when you select a preload folder during submission.  Example  For an example of an SRA Upload, see  issue 14963 .  How long does it take?  If your request is for a small number of files, it will generally be done within a few minutes. The more files requested,\nthe longer the request will take.  What can go wrong?  A few things can go wrong with this process:  1) Requested SEQIDs are not available. If we can't find some of the SEQIDs that you request, you will get a warning\nmessage informing you of it.  2) FTP timeout. Sometimes, particularly for larger requests, the upload to the FTP will run into problems and time out,\nin which case you will likely get an error message similar to this:  [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer . If this occurs,\nyou can either try again later, or, if you had a large request, try splitting it into a few smaller requests. If the\nproblem persists, send us an email and we'll try to get it figured out.  3) Bad FTP credentials. If the username and password for the NCBI FTP site didn't work you'll get a message telling you so.\nMake sure your username is on the first line of the request and password is second.  4) FTP folder does not exist. If the FTP folder specified on the third line of the description isn't correct,\nyou'll get a message saying so.",

Description  All you need to put in the description is a list of SEQIDs you want to look for plasmids in, one per line.  Example  For an example MobSuite, see  issue 12823 .  Interpreting Results  MobSuite outputs quite a few files. The zip file uploaded will have one folder for each SEQID requested.\nWithin each folder, you will find a number of MobSuite output files. Of particular interest is the  contig_report.txt  file,\nwhich assigns each contig in your assembly as chromosomal or plasmid, and has typing info on plasmid-derived contigs.\nFull descriptions of all files can be found at the  MobSuite GitHub repository .  How long does it take?  MobSuite works fairly quickly - it should take roughly one minute to analyze each SEQID that you have requested.  What can go wrong?  A few things can go wrong with this process:  1) Requested SEQIDs are not available. If we can't find some of the SEQIDs that you request, you will get a warning\nmessage informing you of it.  2) FTP timeout. Sometimes, particularly for larger requests, the upload of results to the FTP will run into problems and time out,\nin which case you will likely get an error message similar to this:  [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer . If this occurs,\nyou can either try again later, or, if you had a large request, try splitting it into a few smaller requests. If the\nproblem persists, send us an email and we'll try to get it figured out.",

PrimerFinder Supremacy  is able to process FASTA- and FASTQ-formatted files. If using FASTQ files,  BBMap  is employed to bait out reads containing primer sequences. A second \nround of baiting is performed using the previously-baited reads. Contigs are assembled by  SPAdes  with only the baited reads.

If you want to \nlearn more about it, check out the  Roary publication .  Scoary  Scoary takes the  gene_presence_absence.csv  file output from Roary and a traits file created by the user, and calculates the associations between the given traits and all genes in the accessory genome.

Description  Required Components  In the  Description  field, you must provide the requested analysis type as follows:  analysistype=requested_analysis  The Roary automator supports the following analyses which perform operations on the pan genome of isolate sequences (again, spelling counts, but case sensitivity doesn't):   union - reports the union of genes found in sequences  intersection - reports the intersection of genes found in isolate sequences (core genes)  complement - reports the complement of genes found in isolates (accessory genes)  gene_multifasta - extracts the sequence of each gene listed and creates multi-fasta files for each gene listed (outputs protein multi-fastas).  NOTE : you must provide an additional line:  genes=gene1,gene2,geneN  which is a comma-separated list of genes you would like multi-fasta files for (eg.  genes=fliC,gyrA ).

            "text": "What does it do?  StrainMash uses the MinHash algorithm (as implemented by  mash ) in order to very quickly\nfind which RefSeq type strain an assembly is closest to. This can be very useful if you aren't entirely sure what species\nit is that you've actually sequnced.  How do I use it?  Subject  In the  Subject  field, put  StrainMash . Spelling counts, but case sensitivity doesn't.  Description  All you need to put in the description is a list of SEQIDs you want to analyze, one per line.  Example  For an example StrainMash, see  issue 12860 .  Interpreting Results  StrainMash will upload a zip file once it finishes. This contains a folder called output, which will have a\ntext file for each SEQID entered showing results.  These text files have 6 columns:   MashDistance: Represents roughly how close the query sequence is the the reference strain. 1 is a perfect match, 0 is no\nsimilarity. To say that something very closely matches a reference strain, this number should be  at least  0.98  NumMatchingHashes: Another measure of how close the query sequence is to the reference strain. 1000/1000 is a perfect match,\n0 is no similarity. Number needs to be fairly high ( 850) for close matches to reference.  MedianMultiplicity: Can mostly be ignored. Should always be 1.  Pvalue: An attempt to assign significance to the hit. Should be zero for anything that very closely matches a reference\nstrain.  ReferenceStrain: The NCBI Accession for the reference strain.  Organism: The name of the organism that is the reference strain.   How long does it take?  StrainMash should take about 30 seconds to 1 minute to analyze each sample you send to it.  What can go wrong?  1) Requested SEQIDs are not available. If we can't find some of the SEQIDs that you request, you will get a warning\nmessage informing you of it.",
