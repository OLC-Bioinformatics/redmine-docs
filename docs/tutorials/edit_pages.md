## Edit pages

This is the way I edit pages. Feel free to use any method with which you are comfortable

- Get the mkdocs preview started

`mkdocs serve`

- Navigate to the served pages in your browser e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redmine-docs/`

- Ensure that the page you are going to edit is present in the Nav bar e.g. 'Analysis' -> 'SISTR'

	- You should see an empty page


- Open the markdown file with your favourite editor

- Update the documentation using markdown language - I usually use one of the other files in the folder as a template to ensure that I'm following the same basic format each time

	- Every time you save your document, the served page will refresh
