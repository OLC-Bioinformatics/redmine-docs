## Overview: How to add your documentation

In general when there are instructions in `code`, most of these are the commands you would enter in a terminal window on a linux computer connected to the NAS.

To edit the OLC-Redmine page I would visit these tutorials in order:

1. **Open environment:** be in the right user space in the terminal to open the preview server and publish your changes in the end
2. **Create page:** make a new page to document a new automator
3. **Edit pages:** open the mkdocs preview and edit existing pages
4. **Publish changes:** learn how to use Github credentials to publish changes

If you do not have a Github account yet I would suggest creating one before going to edit these pages because you will be required to use your account to publish changes. Ask a bioinformatician if they can add you to the [OLC-Bioinformatics/redmine-doc](https://github.com/OLC-Bioinformatics/redmine-docs) repository.
